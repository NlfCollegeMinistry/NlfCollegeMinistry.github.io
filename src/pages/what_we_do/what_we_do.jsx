        <p>New Life college house churches that meet on Rice and UH campuses. <br></br>Although students at Rice and the University of Houston do not physically <br></br>meet in homes from week to week, they do meet as a house church every <br></br>Friday on campus to share lives together. Then on Sundays, Rice and UH students <br></br>come to the New Life church building and worship with the other <br></br>75+ house churches that make up the New Life church body.</p>

        <h1>New Life Fellowship Church</h1>
        <p>New Life Fellowship (NLF) is committed to building the <br></br>body of Christ as modeled by the New Testament. We often read <br></br>in the book of Acts as well in Paulâ€™s letters the early <br></br>believers meeting regularly as a house church. We often say <br></br>at our church that if the 75+ house churches did not exist <br></br>we would not have a church.  </p>
